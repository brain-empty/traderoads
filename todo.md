# near future
- have a tavern where you pay for information. information is randomly picked, it can describe the conditions and/or hte probability of bandits on the road (in plain words obviously)
    - tavern can also be used to hear rumours possibly, if i were to add random encounters down the line so you can't min max the game and there's an element of randomness post setup too

# way in the future
- port the game to C# or integrate it with .NET MAUI in some way. till then, the game will be purely ran through a terminal screen.
